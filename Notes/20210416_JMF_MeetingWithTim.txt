Acausal system -> markov property?
  Causality is an instance of MP
Hard constraints vs. penalty terms
f and l is input
  There's a deterministic a prior load plus a stochastic component to the load
  Eq 3 => he would've gone one step before, 
  There's multiple things we want to do -> don't do eq3 first,
    Maybe take f and l out first to estimate the state
  We have inputs, states, meas, no quantity can be both at once.
  In his world,

  White noise on 
  GP approach lets you use the state eq. to define a baysian priors
Suggestion: in contin. time world, 
  Try to handle precurved rod by neglecting first part of d/ds eq.
First problem to work on:
  Neglect the -Kinv term? Implement the full thing in MatLab
  Should be able to sample from the prior
One final teaser: it will be easy to implement for parallel continuum robots
Most importatn part: once you've estimated at discrete points, it's super easy to query the state at ANY s: computationally efficient (O(1))

Really read the full steam ahead paper many times
  Read the two papers in order 
   -1: Read rassmussen and williams Ch. 2 and 3
      Maybe code up a 1D GP model or something
    0: Ch. 3 of book, linear models in motion and sensor
    1: Implementing batch CTE with GPs, linear motion, nonlinear sensor
    2: Extending to SE(3), nonlear for both
